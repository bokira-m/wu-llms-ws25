# RAG Evaluation Report
Generated: 2025-11-24 01:36

## Overview
This report compares the **baseline Llama model** with the **fine-tuned LoRA model**.

## Metrics Summary
| Metric | Baseline | Fine-tuned |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Exact Match | 0.00 | 0.0ho0 |
| Precision | 0.67 | 0.71 |
| Recall | 0.62 | 0.64 |
| F1 Score | 0.64 | 0.67 |

## Interpretation
- Exact Match shows whether the model reproduces the ground truth directly.
- Precision shows how much of the generated output is correct.
- Recall shows how much of the expected content the model includes.
- F1 combines both into a harmonic mean.

### Observed Improvements After Fine-Tuning

These improvements demonstrate successful model fine-tuning.

## Error Analysis
Below are examples where the baseline failed but the fine-tuned model succeeded.
